## Project Overview

This repository provides an implementation of basic data structures and algorithms.
The code for the various data structures can be found in the directory `data_structures`, while the sorting and search algorithms are in `algorithms/sort` and `algorithms/search`, respectively.
All the data structures and algorithms have been tested using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) (see `tests` folder for details).

## 1. Data structures

Currently, this project offers an implementation of: tries, trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, doubly circular linked lists, heaps, hash tables, graphs, and array list.

## 2. Algorithms

### 2.1. Search algorithm

The code contains an implementation of three search algorithms namely: binary search, breadth first search and depth first search.

### 2.2. Sorting algorithm

Additionally, this repository implements two sorting algorithms: merge sort and quick sort.
